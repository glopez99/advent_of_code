#Advent of Code

Here are my journey's of learning how to code through Advent of Code.

I started Advent of Code in 2018 with me solving as many problems as I could with Google Sheets.
While it was fun, it also encouraged me to learn how to code so I could solve more.

In 2020, after much self-learning and mentorship, I challenged myself to only solve them through my coding skills.
Imagine my surprise when my skills improved and my love for coding grew.

For 2021, my goal is to limit myself to 90mins per solution, to challenge myself not to be faster,
but to trust my instincts and my knowledge of code. I have found myself to still be timid when asked for
a solution, so this is to help me build confidence in myself.
